DESCRIPTION :

This project  is about choosing a popular application and redesigning its UI.
For this project I have choosed "Linkedin" application in which i have only made one change which might be 
very usefull for the users based on my experiance while using this application.
I have redesigned buttons based on the priority of its usage. So here I have placed the "create post" icon to the lower center of screen for
easy access and removed the "video" icon for there and placed it in the top where we previously had the"create post" icon.
Here we are using the "create post" icon frequently so if i keep that in center it will be easy to acces.
